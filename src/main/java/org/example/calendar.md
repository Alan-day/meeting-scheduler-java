### Overview

Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a co-worker. You have access to your calendar and your co-worker's calendar (both of which contain your respective meetings for the day, in the form of `[startTime, endTime]` ), as well as both of your daily bounds (i.e., the earliest and latest times at which you're available for meetings every day, in the form of `[earliestTime, latestTime]` ).  
Write a method that takes in your calendar, your daily bounds, your co-worker's calendar, your coworker's daily bounds, and the duration of the meeting that you want to schedule, and that returns a list of all the time blocks (in the form of `[startTime, endTime]` ) during which you could schedule the meeting, ordered from earliest time block to latest.  
Note that times will be given and should be returned in military time. For example: 8:30 , 9:01 , and 23:56

**Sample Input**  
`calendar1 = [['9:00', '10:30'], ['12:00', '13:00'], ['16:00', '18:00']]`  
`dailyBounds1 = ['9:00', '20:00']`  
`calendar2 = [['10:00', '11:30'], ['12:30', '14:30'], ['14:30', '15:00'], ['16:00', '17:00']]`  
`dailyBounds2 = ['10:00', '18:30']`  
`meetingDuration = 30`

**Sample Output**  
`[['11:30', '12:00'], ['15:00', '16:00'], ['18:00', '18:30']]`

### Goals

- Clean Code: Feel free to solve this via a brute force solution to begin with... but then use this as a refactoring exercise to also see how clean and efficient you can make your solution.
- Tested: There should be multiple test cases demonstrating your working solution.

### Specification

- Note that the given calendar times will be sorted by start time in ascending order, as you would expect them to appear in a calendar application like Google Calendar.
